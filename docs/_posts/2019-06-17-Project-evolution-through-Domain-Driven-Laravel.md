title: "Project Evolution through Domain Driven Laravel"

Starting with a monolithic application there are three possible phases of Domain Driven Laravel (DDL):

1. Seam creation/Creation of discrete bounded contexts/Designed communication systems between different parts of the application
2. Movement of Service/Context into composer included package, updating only facade anti-corruption (ACL) layer to facilitate.
3. (Optional) Movement of Service/Context out of the shared kernel design into a entirely separate application, updating only the facade anti-corruption (ACL) layer to facilitate.
